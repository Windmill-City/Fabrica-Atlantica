Pyrotech Bloomery is used to make iron from scraps early game.
First, individual pieces of scrap iron needs to be compressed into a block in a mechanical compacter. The block can then be put into the bloomery, followed by a fuel block (charcoal, coke, etc...). Bloomery can be accelerated by  bellows and extra fuels.
After the burn is complete, the bloom needs to be remove by a pyrotech tong (not forgecraft one!) and hammered on a granite/ironclad anvil. Watch out for fire in your base!
